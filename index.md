## Research Experiences
* **Parametric Bootstrap on Networks**, University of California, Davis, advisor: Prof. Can M. Le | Ongoing
  + Analogue of the classical parametric bootstrap method on random networks
  + Bias reduction and accuracy improvement by a second-level bootstrap
* **Spectral properties of overfitted SBM**, University of California, Davis, advisor: Prof. Can M. Le | Ongoing
* **Causal Inference with Outcomes Truncated by Death**, Peking University, supervised by Prof. Xiao-Hua Zhou | Mar 2018 – July 2018
  + Improved the method ([*Wang et al., Identification and estimation of causal effects with outcomes truncated by death, Biometrika, 2017*](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asx034)) with its optimization steps
  + Derived the asymptotic variance of the estimator, which showed good coverage property according to simulation results.
  + Developed an R Package (named [tbd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tbd/index.html) on CRAN), and applied it to real clinical data.
<!-- * **Causal Structure Learning**, University of Washington, supervised by Prof. Ali Shojaie | July 2018 – Aug 2018 -->
<!--   + Tried to seek the lower bound of the volume of unfaithful distributions when using the [Reduced PC-Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06209) for causal structure learning -->
<!--   + Considered an alternative “top-down” approach of the Reduced PC-Algorithm
 -->
 
## Internship
* **Tencent IEG, Lightspeed & Quantum Studios Group**, Summer 2021
  + **User clustering using community detection and node embedding techniques** 
  + **Stolen accounts detection in PUBG mobile** 
<!--   Based on in-game friend relations as well as user attributes data, we were able to
    - Identify small groups that always team up.
    - Discover user clusters with common features, e.g. city.
    - Define affinity between users based on the embeddings. -->
  
<!--   Built an XGBoost classifier based on user features in consecutive weeks. Upon noticing the clustering tendency within stolen accounts, we enhanced the performance by adding user affinity embedding into the model. -->
* **AppLovin**, Summer 2022
  + Hyperparameter tuning on bidder models (offline experiments and A/B testing)
* **Pinterest**, Summer 2023
  + Experiments on oCPM model structures
