## Research Experiences
* **Causal Inference with Outcomes Truncated by Death**, Peking University, supervised by Prof. Xiao-Hua Zhou | Mar 2018 – July 2018
  + Improved the method ([*Wang et al., Identification and estimation of causal effects with outcomes truncated by death, Biometrika, 2017*](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asx034)) with its optimization steps
  + Derived the asymptotic variance of the estimator, which showed good coverage property according to simulation results.
  + Developed an R Package (named [tbd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tbd/index.html) on CRAN), and applied it to real clinical data.
* **Causal Structure Learning**, University of Washington, supervised by Prof. Ali Shojaie | July 2018 – Aug 2018
  + Tried to seek the lower bound of the volume of unfaithful distributions when using the [Reduced PC-Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06209) for causal structure learning
  + Considered an alternative “top-down” approach of the Reduced PC-Algorithm
* **Parametric Bootstrap on Networks**, University of California, Davis, advisor: Prof. Can M. Le | Ongoing
  + Approximate the distribution of various functions of random networks, by first estimating the network generating model and then sampling from the estimated model.
  + Especially interesting for *local* statistics, of which the noise in a single observation is large. By estimating the work we can essentially use information from the rest of the network.
  + Discover settings and conditions under which network samples from the estimated model are likely to recover the true distribution
  + Observed boostrap bias for many functions, e.g., triangle counts and clustering coefficients. Propose a de-biasing method by a second-level bootstrap

## Internship
* **Tencent IEG, Lightspeed & Quantum Studios Group**, Summer 2021
  + **User clustering using community detection and node embedding techniques.** Made use of in-game friend relations as well as user attributes. We were able to
    - Identify small groups that always team up.
    - Discover user clusters with common features, e.g. city.
    - Define affinity between users based on the embeddings.
  + **Identify stealed accounts in PUBG mobile.** Compared features of normal and stealed accounts. Build an XGBoost classifier based on user features in consecutive weeks. We also noticed *clustering tendency* within stealed accounts. By adding user affinity into the model, we enhanced the performace significantly, especially when positive labels are rare.

## Honors
* **Excellent Research Award**, Peking University, Oct 2018

## Skills
Proficient in Python, R, Familiar with C++, SQL, Mathematica
