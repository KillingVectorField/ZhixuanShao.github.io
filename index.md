## Research Experiences
* Causal Inference with Outcomes Truncated by Death, Peking University, supervised by Prof. Xiao-Hua Zhou | Mar 2018 – July 2018
  + Improved the method ([Wang et al., Identification and estimation of causal effects with outcomes truncated by death, Biometrika, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asx034)) with its optimization steps
  + Derived the asymptotic variance of the estimator, which showed good coverage property according to simulation results.
  + Developed an R Package (named [tbd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tbd/index.html) on CRAN), and applied it to real clinical data. A related paper is in preparation.

## Honors
* **Excellent Research Award**, Peking University, Oct 2018
